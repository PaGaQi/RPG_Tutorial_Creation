## What to Note About Tutorials

Tutorials are the first impressions of a game, so they must be a good one. If the first impression your player gets of your game is a bad one, chances are they will stop playing, and that's the worst thing a player can do to your game.

They also teach the player how to play the game, so it's very important players don't skip it, because they won't understand basic mechanics without it, and that might create frustration. 

It's important to note that tutorials aren't just "a level". This means that a tutorial isn't just a small room where the player learns all of the mechanics of a game; tutorials happen every single time a player learns something new about your game, even in later parts.

Finally, different games will require different types of tutorial, depending on the complexity and design of the game.


## 1. Less Text

Using too much text can lead to a complete stop of the immerssion and pacing of the game. Like I said before, tutorials are the first impression of a game, and if that impression is a giant, unskippable wall of text you're going to kill a lot of the interest the player has. 

Having a giant wall of text can be very overwheling to the player. This will make the players skip your tutorial, and if a player skips the tutorial they won't know how to play and they'll eventually get frustrated and stop playing (and that's the last thing we want).

Instead of telling the player what to do, let the player PLAY the game to learn what to do. Experiencing things by yourself makes you internalize them better, and remember them better in the long run. Plus, having interactive tutorials will stop the player from getting easily bored and thus the player will be more invested in the game.

Not all mechanics can be explained through play, obviously. In the cases where you can't explain a mechanic through interactivity I'd recommend trying to keep the text to a minimum.

An example of what a badly implemented text tutorial looks like is in Final Fantasy VII Remake. In this video, Cloud is about to battle some guards when text appears on screen. The first time this happens it's not that big of a deal, the amout of text is relatively small and it happens before the action has started so the pacing isn't hit too bad. The second time it happens though (6:15), a pop up appears on screen while Cloud is attacking the guards. This is the worst thing you can do in a tutorial. You should never interrupt the player while he's playing your game. Taking control away from the player can (and in most cases will) lead to frustration, and if you abuse this too much you'll most likely end up losing most of your players.

## 2. Don't Frontload  

Don't overwhelm the player with information at the beginning. This will only make the players forget, get bored and get frustrated. If you introduce all of the info at the start you'll be introducing information before the player is invested in the game, so they'll likely won't care enough to internalize it that early on. In addition to this, information that's not needed at the time will be introduced, and it's very likely that mechanics that aren't relevant in the beggining will be forgoten later on by the player.

This approach also prevents the player from actually playing the game. If the first 10 minutes of your game are a boring tutorial two things can happen: either the player skips your tutorial (which means you've failed as a designer), or you lose the player forever.
   
## 3. Make it Fun  
   Use interactivity to your advantage, don't just teach the player, teach him while he's playing.
   
## 4. Reinforce Learning Through Play  
   Try to design the levels to be intuitive enough so that the player can learn the basic concept of mechanics without having to use words.

## 5. Playtest a Lot 
   Don't take your design decisions for granted. Observe your playtesters and listen to them.
   
## 6. Don't Create a Nuisance  
   Don't make your tutorial annoying; if you're creating a "classic" tutorial make it skippable, and if not try to make it not interrupt the flow of gameplay.
   
## 7. Accessible at all Times  
   Let the player revisit old information (with a mecahnic encyclopedia, a training room, or allow him to replay tutorials). This is especially true with mecahnically complex games.
   
## 8. Don't Leave it For Last  
   Implement the tutorials at the same time you implement the mechanics. Think about how the players will learn about the mechanics as you create them.
