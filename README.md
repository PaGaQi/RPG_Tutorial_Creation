# RPG Tutorial Creation

## 1. Don't Put Too Much Text  
Let the player play the new mechanics instead of telling him what they do.
   
## 2. Don't Frontload  
   Don't overwhelm the player with information at the beginning; instead try to spread out the info, and only use it when it's relevant.
   
## 3. Make it Fun  
   Use interactivity to your advantage, don't just teach the player, teach him while he's playing.
   
## 4. Reinforce Learning Through Play  
   Try to design the levels to be intuitive enough so that the player can learn the basic concept of mechanics without having to use words.

## 5. Playtest a Lot 
   Don't take your design decisions for granted. Observe your playtesters and listen to them.
   
## 6. Don't Create a Nuisance  
   Don't make your tutorial annoying; if you're creating a "classic" tutorial make it skippable, and if not try to make it not interrupt the flow of gameplay.
   
## 7. Accessible at all Times  
   Let the player revisit old information (with a mecahnic encyclopedia, a training room, or allow him to replay tutorials). This is especially true with mecahnically complex games.
   
## 8. Don't Leave it For Last  
   Implement the tutorials at the same time you implement the mechanics. Think about how the players will learn about the mechanics as you create them.
