# RPG Tutorial Creation

## What to Note About Tutorials
Tutorials are the first impressions of a game, so they must be a good one. If the first impression your player gets of your game is a bad one, chances are they will stop playing, and that's the worst thing a player can do to your game.

They also teach the player how to play the game, so it's very important players don't skip it, because they won't understand basic mechanics without it, and that might create frustration. 

It's important to note that tutorials aren't just "a level". This means that a tutorial isn't just a small room where the player learns all of the mechanics of a game; tutorials happen every single time a player learns something new about your game, even in later parts.

Finally, different games will require different types of tutorial, depending on the complexity and design of the game.



## 1. Don't Put Too Much Text  
Let the player play the new mechanics instead of telling him what they do.
   
## 2. Don't Frontload  
   Don't overwhelm the player with information at the beginning; instead try to spread out the info, and only use it when it's relevant.
   
## 3. Make it Fun  
   Use interactivity to your advantage, don't just teach the player, teach him while he's playing.
   
## 4. Reinforce Learning Through Play  
   Try to design the levels to be intuitive enough so that the player can learn the basic concept of mechanics without having to use words.

## 5. Playtest a Lot 
   Don't take your design decisions for granted. Observe your playtesters and listen to them.
   
## 6. Don't Create a Nuisance  
   Don't make your tutorial annoying; if you're creating a "classic" tutorial make it skippable, and if not try to make it not interrupt the flow of gameplay.
   
## 7. Accessible at all Times  
   Let the player revisit old information (with a mecahnic encyclopedia, a training room, or allow him to replay tutorials). This is especially true with mecahnically complex games.
   
## 8. Don't Leave it For Last  
   Implement the tutorials at the same time you implement the mechanics. Think about how the players will learn about the mechanics as you create them.
